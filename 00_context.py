# MAGIC ### Overview
# MAGIC Wind power forecasting is essential for adequate power system stability, dispatching and cost control. Wind power is a favorable power source for green electricity generation and prediction is a crucial topic in reducing the energy lifecycle's unpredictability. Balancing energy supply and demand is critical to ensure that all energy produced from wind power is in deed actually being used. The goal of the Solution Accelerator is to provide dataset-based prediction tool for estimating wind power. Additionally, graph and tablular visulizations are provided to relay a better understanding of the wind and power production relationship and the algoristhms and methods used for forecasted predictions.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Using public SCADA datasets that include theoretical power, produced active power, wind direction, wind speed, month and hour, generated turbine power is forecasted using machine learning algorithms.

# MAGIC ##### About This Series of Notebooks
# MAGIC  * This series of notebooks is intended to help utility companies and wind farms correctly forecast the amount of load the farm can provide the utility.
# MAGIC  * In support of this goal, we will:
# MAGIC     * Load the SCADA data provided by each wind turbine, in the farm, into our training data from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkerisen/wind-turbine-scada-dataset.
# MAGIC     * Create a pipeline for streaming forecassted wind speed and direction in near real-time and/or on an ad-hoc basis. This pipeline can then be used for managing tables for reporting, ad hoc queries, and/or decision support.
# MAGIC     * Use Databricks mlflow for built-in Machine Learning algorithms.
# MAGIC     * Create a dashboard for monitoring the predicted supplied load.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ##### Data used in this Solutions Accelerator
# MAGIC   * Yalova, Turkey wind farm dataset from Kaggle 
# MAGIC   * Wind data from Tomorrow.ai https://app.tomorrow.io/home
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ###### Turkey wind farm dataset from Kaggle 
# MAGIC Publicly available dataset gathered from Turkey's north eastern region at the Yalova, Marmara BÃ¶lgesi wind farm.
# MAGIC The SCADA system was used to collect temperature, wind speed, wind direction, produced power, and date and time.
# MAGIC   * The dataset used in this accelerator is from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkerisen/  wind-turbine-scada-dataset).
# MAGIC   * Further details about this dataset
# MAGIC   * Dataset title: Wind Turbine Scada Dataset
# MAGIC     ^2018 Scada Data of a Wind Turbine in Turkey^
# MAGIC   * Dataset source URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkerisen/wind-turbine-scada-dataset
# MAGIC   * Dataset source description: BERK ERISEN added the dataset to Kaggle 5 year ago, the country Turkey provided a year, 2018, of SCADA data from a Wind Farm
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ###### Wind Data
# MAGIC   * Real time forecasted wind speed and direction is obtained from Weatherstack. Tomorrow.ai offers current weather data, forecasts, and historical weather data, (-7 days to 7 days). They have a free plan with limited features. https://docs.tomorrow.io/reference/intro/getting-started
