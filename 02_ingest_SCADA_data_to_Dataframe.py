# MAGIC ### Overview - Ingest SCADA Data - SCADA data collection and dataset analysis
# MAGIC Wind turbines have eletronic devices attached to them with SCADA software, these devices are remotely connected to the SCADA system. The SCADA system collects data about the turbine on a continuous basis. The collected data includes details such as produced power, direction and speed of wind, and date and time. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Predicting forecasted power of wind turbines can help wind farm's make decisions regarding produced power, consumption and management of storage-capacity.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC During the time period January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018, the data was taken as time-series data at 10 minute intervals.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ##### In this notebook you will:
# MAGIC * Access the SCADA dataset from Databricks Repo and unzip.
# MAGIC * Read the data to a DataFrame in `Delta` format for easy access and queriability.
# MAGIC * Explore the dataset and relationships for any needed future cleaning/wrangling/normalizing.
# MAGIC * Understand the incoming SCADA Wind Turnine Dataset 

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ##### Download the SCADA dataset from Databricks Repo and unzip.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sh -e
# MAGIC # move into the datasets directory
# MAGIC # watch out, know that this tmp directory is in your workspace, not in root tmp, we will handle this later when we read the file
# MAGIC cd /tmp
# MAGIC # Access the zipped SCADA dataset from Databricks Repo and unzip the dataset file
# MAGIC unzip -o /Workspace/Repos/rnieder@newmathdata.com/dbsa_wind_turbine_load_prediction/datasets/scada_data.csv.zip
# MAGIC
# MAGIC # make sure the file was unzipped by listing the files in the datasets directory
# MAGIC ls 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC pwd
# MAGIC # run this code block, below you should see a `.csv` file

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ##### Read the SCADA data to a DataFrame in `Delta` format for easy access and queriability. Data will be in `Delta Lake`
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

import os
from pathlib import Path
import platform

# Get the path of the temporary directory, this will be the `/tmp` directory in your workspace, not the systems environment
file_path = f"file:///tmp/scada_data.csv"
print(f"file_path:::{file_path}")

# Read the dataset into the session storage. In Databricks notebooks, the SparkSession is created for you, and stored in the variable `spark`.
df_data_wind_farm = spark.read.csv(file_path, header=True, inferSchema=True, multiLine="true", escape='"')

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ##### Explore the dataset and relationships for any needed future cleaning/wrangling/normalizing.

# COMMAND ----------

# Check to make sure the data looks correct and look for any data cleaning and normalization we need to do later
df_data_wind_farm.show()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC **Understand of the incoming SCADA Wind Turnine Dataset**

# COMMAND ----------

# First, lets look at the dataset

# MAGIC ###### SCADA Data from Yalova Wind Farm in the Northern Region of Turkey
# MAGIC | field | type | description |
# MAGIC |---|---|---|
# MAGIC | theoretical power | float | Theoretical maximum power output of the wind turbine under ideal conditions. | Measured in kW.
# MAGIC | produced active power | float | The active power produced by a turbine refers to the actual electrical power output generated by the turbine. |
# MAGIC | wind direction | float | Wind direction refers to the direction from which the wind is blowing. Measured in degrees Celcius. |
# MAGIC | wind speed | float | Wind speed is the rate at which air moves horizontally past a specific point on the Earth's surface. Measured in meters per second. |
# MAGIC | time | Datetime | ISO 8601 format for representing date and time is "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS" where: YYYY represents the year, MM represents the month, DD represents the day, T is a separator indicating the start of the time part, HH represents the hour (in 24-hour format), MM represents the minute, SS represents the second. For example: "2024-05-08T14:30:00" represents May 8th, 2024, at 2:30 PM. |
