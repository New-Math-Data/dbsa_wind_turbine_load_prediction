# MAGIC ## Overview
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Wind power forecasting is essential for adequate power system stability, dispatching and cost control. Wind power is a favorable power source for green electricity generation and prediction is a crucial topic in reducing the energy lifecycle's unpredictability. Balancing energy supply and demand is critical to ensure that all energy produced from wind power is in deed actually being used. The goal of the Solution Accelerator is to provide dataset-based prediction tool for estimating wind power. Additionally, graph and tablular visulizations are provided to relay a better understanding of the wind and power production relationship and the algoristhms and methods used for forecasted predictions.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC # Using public SCADA datasets that include theoretical power, produced active power, wind direction, wind speed, month and hour, generated turbine power is forecasted using machine learning algorithms.

# MAGIC ## Overview - Ingest Data
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### In this notebook you will:
# MAGIC * Download the SCADA dataset from Databricks Repo.
# MAGIC * Unzip the SCADA dataset.
# MAGIC * Create a schema/database for the tables to reside in.
# MAGIC * Move the downloaded SCADA dataset into object storage.
# MAGIC * Write the data out in `Delta` format.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ## Step 1: Download the SCADA dataset from Databricks Repo
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this step, we will:
# MAGIC   1. Access the zipped SCADA dataset from Databricks Repo
# MAGIC   2. Unzip the SCADA dataset

# COMMAND ----------

%sh -e
cd $tmpdir
unzip -o /Workspace/Repos/rnieder@newmathdata.com/dbsa_wind_turbine_load_prediction/datasets/scada_data.csv.zip

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Step 3: Create Schema/Database

# COMMAND ----------

spark.sql(f"DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS {wind_turbine_load_prediction} CASCADE")
spark.sql(f"CREATE DATABASE {wind_turbine_load_prediction}")
spark.sql(f"USE {wind_turbine_load_prediction}")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Step 4: Create Delta Table
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this step, we will:
# MAGIC   1. Create a permanent delta table (Bronze table for raw data)

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Access the Data File
# COMMAND ----------
# MAGIC SCADA Data from Turkey Wind Farm
# MAGIC field | type | description
# MAGIC theoretical power | float | theoretical maximum power output of the wind turbine under ideal conditions.
# MAGIC produced active power | float | The active power produced by a turbine refers to the actual electrical power output generated by the turbine.
# MAGIC  wind direction | float | Wind direction refers to the direction from which the wind is blowing. Measured in degrees.
# MAGIC  wind speed | float | Wind speed is the rate at which air moves horizontally past a specific point on the Earth's surface. Measured in meters per second.
# MAGIC  time | Datetime | ISO 8601 format for representing date and time is "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS" where: YYYY represents the year, MM represents the month, DD represents the day, T is a separator indicating the start of the time part, HH represents the hour (in 24-hour format), MM represents the minute, SS represents the second. For example: "2024-05-08T14:30:00" represents May 8th, 2024, at 2:30 PM.
